Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained.
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUTCAP and BALANCE.
"THe Art of the Deal--""The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have."" CUT CAP and BALANCE."
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency.

@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?
"@johnboehner  @EricCantor  ""You can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods people will eventually catch on."" - The Art of the Deal"
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.
Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.

China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership it can be stopped.

The Misery Index is at a 28 year high.

Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast.

Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico. @BarackObama can't be bothered he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes.

China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama  http://t.co/mV75eJFy  Of course. Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough.
I was putting together my early deals in New York &amp; I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself &amp; you can do anything.
It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden  http://t.co/UkCnZrrJ

After four  years of getting the run-around America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. @PaulRyanVP
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Too busy playing golf? @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic  signature to the parents of fallen SEALs   http://t.co/ELKcqTyr

Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
Is this Hope &amp; Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better.
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp; trade during @BarackObama's term.
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans http://t.co/tJPJqsBV  Big mistake!

I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136260 per household a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts etc.
The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!
Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him?

Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.
"The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting ""Four More Years."" Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?"
After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip http://t.co/T5xzkNuL  They have zero respect for us. Outrageous!
Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people. --@MittRomney
We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion -- @MittRomney
Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt.
Under @BarackObama 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps.
"The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants @GiulianaRancic and me singing ""Call Me Maybe""  http://t.co/5HzwnSvM   has over 2M views."

Drew Peterson a real sleaze just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty.
Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88921000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
There are now 119000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible.
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force &amp; have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery phony numbers
This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: http://t.co/NY3DQGrT   Disaster.
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence go with your gut!
During @BarackObama's presidency median family income has fallen 4.8% http://t.co/OqAgfiQ7  Terrible for the middle class.

On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.
The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers &amp; their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
84% of US troops wounded &amp; 70% of our brave men &amp; women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?

I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.

Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday September 24 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
It's Thursday how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?

My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race.
Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes. Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate? #Debate #Obama
.@acuconservative's #CPACCO kept up the momentum from the debate. @MittRomney even made a surprise appearance. Now go win CO!
“The team with the best players wins.” -- @jack_welch
Looking forward to Sunday’s speech in the ExCel Centre. http://t.co/SV6KAS1E
More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate.  A new record.  See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)!
Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial death penalty.
My @foxandfriends interview discussing Obama's failed and dangerous foreign policy and the real unemployment numbers http://t.co/6Y1UToMt
I would do same thing if I were China.  They want Obama. http://t.co/sal9WpKV
A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps http://t.co/0acwArSn  Four more years?
Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama?
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses http://t.co/A8UyBknk Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
.@jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE.
.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
.@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
Greece should get out of the euro &amp; go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
California gas prices going thru the roof others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates the real state of unemployment &amp; bias media http://t.co/p8U4JmYg
Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also not a pressure player.
In the end Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again a lot.
George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
Donald Trump: ‘Monkey business’ on jobs http://t.co/JjVkVmNE via @politico
When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly after the election!
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
With these record high gas prices what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
“In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts you need to know about real estate.” - Think Like a Billionaire
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
.@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends.
By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night. It will be very interesting I promise.
I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. -- Mitt
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
Remember Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes. Be careful of voter fraud!
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election we decide whether we become great again.
I just had to fire someone he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate http://t.co/nkPWyb1m What is he thinking?
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding http://t.co/1XB8OK2t  Do people think this is fair?
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
Consumer spending fell in September http://t.co/BG0U7bYz  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.
You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird.  -- @MittRomney
I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
Even with lower profit projections American firms are still throwing money into China http://t.co/xRJlsxqB  Obama is killing investment.
"Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an ""A"" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor."
I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower. People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium &amp; waterfall.
Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad http://t.co/VQI57pcd  Foreign candidate getting foreign donations.
@usa67us  Thank you
When everything seems to be going against you remember that the airplane takes off against the wind not with it. -- Henry Ford
Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
"Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it ""mildly"" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter."
.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2
"Why the hell did we help the Libyan ""rebels"" in the first place. That is the real scandal."
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince http://t.co/6KErqMup  Sounds like his book bio!
It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? http://t.co/upa00265 Who is this guy?
Another sign that @jack_welch is right. New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data http://t.co/5wDEDsJZ
.@Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC. Support her campaign here http://t.co/sP2DCsqI
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp; environment destroying Scottish windmills.
Wing bangers-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!
There are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still. -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt
"First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on ""compassionate grounds."" Do you believe?"
Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
With our amazing All Star cast @Joan_Rivers @johnrich @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp; @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. --@PaulRyanVP
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. -- Warren G. Bennis
I told you whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
"When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say "" what were we doing""."
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. 
Tonight despite everything put A-Rod in the lineup. 
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
"Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win(""Winning solves all problems""- (cont) http://t.co/2rVgPfmo"
No I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go they win.
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. 
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
Romney Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABC
Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate http://t.co/3F5Sqe6A  Mitt should bring up college applications &amp; records
If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night Obama is finished!
Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride let time go by.Donald J. Trump
The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. -- @MittRomney
Based on very popular demand I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate.
Donald Trump's back with 14 'Apprentice' All-Stars http://t.co/Jhv9xFF9 via @AP
Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!
@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic my first season winner will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have in my opinion zero talent.
.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit I wish the stuff worked.
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
".@History's wonderful ""The Men Who Built America"" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing I'll be live tweeting the debate"
.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
Between Libya the national security leaks and Fast &amp; Furious Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
".@washtimes ""@BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'"" http://t.co/CcRkSlHY"
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.
Get ready for tonight!
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!
Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
For political purposes only Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
"Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say ""let's get ready to rumble""!"
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
"Obama just said @MittRomney was ""a very successful investor""--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility."
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
Obama weak on immigration. All words no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
You talk tough Mr. President but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
Obama better than last time but again @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
"George Will said ""best debate he ever saw"". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting."
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
Verlander pitched great but @Yankees look truly defeated.
At the debate the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.
Remember I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it he broke his foot.
I still love Derek he is a winner!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period!
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
"My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--&amp; all the ""biggies."" It's like having your own newspaper."
My interview with @RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @yankees &amp; how to terminate his contract http://t.co/dlErLZAE
@marileenelson Thanks
"Via @espn: ""Donald Trump would fire A-Rod""  http://t.co/kom7x1ZP"
Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost  http://t.co/9sL1WhVF
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.
"Remember new ""environment friendly""  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care."
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally &amp; aesthetically.
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
...Bad decisions can be devastating.
Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries  http://t.co/VAisvQlh  via @Newsmax_Media
.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish!
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished they won't quit for CC
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters even A-Rod they got you there.
@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.

Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays however.
Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year the fans will be happy.
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you.
While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back!
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?

@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there &amp; worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio.
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse!
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner.
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!

Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.

Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.

Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
.@Toure when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage stop by and say hello.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.

The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years he will thank me. Be smart Robert.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!
Well this is it the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.

Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama.

Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing not the President.
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
"Last night was the first time Obama said ""we"" instead of ""I"" in respect to Bin Laden's killing."

RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases records http://t.co/xCQbR1j2
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008 American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp; put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records http://t.co/Cn8bn9LH #Election2012
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
... By releasing his records he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
In light the Benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.

“Our side needs Donald Trump.” -- @AnnCoulter on @seanhannity’s show last night.  Thanks Ann.
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
.@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great!
@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.

The dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants. --The America We Deserve
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....
.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!
@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide.
@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.
@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.

The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!
"Be careful of an Obama ""bomb"" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do."
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
By the way where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway who cares I adore Oprah.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.
Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.

I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will.

@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly...you're terrific!

While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.

"Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was ""probably"" born in the US--the word ""probably"" is a disaster for Obama."
Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.

All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below move out!
The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
Not only giving out money but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
Because of the hurricane I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.

@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://t.co/LYXCvaOl
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?

There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice once he releases all of his records.

Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
President Obama missed the deadline!

If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records he would have refused.
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc &amp; websites as to their professionalism &amp; fairness—many people asking for this.
Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
With long gas lines &amp; total disarray from storm the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
.@Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!
.@RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional.
.@BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly I won't be able to do it.
.@TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice apology accepted!
I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island &amp; Long Island.
People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
Interestingly the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
Unemployment is now 7.9%.  Four years and $6.5T later that is really bad!

Obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households.  With Obama Care taxes kicking in now everyone will be paying for his 2nd term.
...Remember--I told you so.
Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation..
This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.  It is pathetic.  Obama is laughing at them.

I hope the Republicans are happy.  Just as I predicted that stupid deal they voted for only whetted Obama’s appetite for more taxes.
Nominating Chuck Hagel for SOD is the wrong move for Obama.  He doesn’t need the fight.  Too much political capital will be wasted.

Be sure to watch “The History of WrestleMania” on @netflix. My interview explains how I supported the event early on. I'm proud of it.
Everyone is excited for @THEGaryBusey’s return to All-Star @CelebApprentice.  Be warned this time Gary is even more insane!
I am very proud of @StephenBaldwin7’s performance in the record 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice. Watch.
Remember no one ever said success was easy.Good luck doesn’t come overnight.But if u work hard &amp; love it u will find success &amp; luck.
One good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers. If you can make it now you deserve it!

Losers and haterseven you as low and dumb as you are can learn from watching Apprentice and checking out my tweets-you can still succeed!
How does this cast look to you? Pretty amazing. #CelebApprentice
Looks like @OMAROSA is up to the challenge. #CelebApprentice
.@LisaRinna looks better with her reduced lips. Good move Lisa. #CelebApprentice
I always believed @BretMichaels was making a mistake in coming back as a competitor. I disagree with him but... http://t.co/7LtrUa2JMh
I can’t believe he would choose @OMAROSA as his first choice! She is hard to handle. #CelebApprentice

.@KellyandMichael are both wonderful people. Their show is terrific. #CelebApprentice
.@OMAROSA as a cashier- a big mistake by @BrandenRoderick. #CelebApprentice
Even @PiersMorgan is impressed by @THEGaryBusey. #CelebApprentice
Paul Teutul is always good on the show. #CelebApprentice
Don't worry West Coast etc. we are not going to tweet who was fired or give any indication there of until after it airs. #CelebApprentice
.@IvankaTrump looks like a movie star from the days of glamour and beauty. #CelebApprentice
.@PiersMorgan is right- he won the show because “I know how to play the game.” #CelebApprentice
I'll always like @OMAROSA because she constantly defends me. #CelebApprentice
So what did you think of my decision? What would you have done? #CelebApprentice
I will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A.M. this morning.
Brande would have been fired immediately if she didn't raise $132000 a really large sum. Bret on the other hand raised very little...

Bret had a target on his back from the get go...
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  Looks like a good season for charities.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.
What do you think of Gary's definition of    f-u-n?

On the whole the teams seem to be working well together. No wars...yet.
What?!  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept &amp; presentation.
Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary while 'adorable' is a distraction?
Re Omarosa: Nasty tough or smart...or all?
Which team is your favorite?
It's true... Dennis is really into this-very animated. I have never seen him this way before.
Re my hair-Should I change it? What do you think?

WHY CAN'T THE MEDIA TELL THE TRUTH - WE WOULD ALL BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF!
I agreed to take the worst spot at CPAC because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time I could be there - it was great fun!
Honest reporters stated that the Prayer Breakfast was going on during my CPAC speech and security was very slow to let people in-long lines!
Thanks for all of the accolades on my speech today - it's all about the truth!

Wow-Record ratings for WGC Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral's Blue Monster-Most watched in seven years. CONGRATS to@Tiger Woods
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 on NBC - GREAT EPISODE!
Last weeks Dateline which I hosted was the highest rated Dateline since January!
Just won The Club Championship at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach-lots of very good golfers-never easy to win a C.C.
@DeViouSDoLL82 It's Endometriosis Awareness Month-176 million women suffer from this disease.
Best ratings for the Dateline show were for six months not two months!
@ANNIKA59    Annika - Thanks you are the GREATEST - We all adore you!
I'll be tweeting live tonight starting at 9PM ET re:@ApprenticeNBC. Don't worry other time zones I will give nothing away!
The tournament at Trump National Doral was much more exciting than what is going on now!
.@Omarosa’s meltdown—was it for real? @DennisRodman thinks she could be an Oscar winner for that performance… #CelebApprentice
Great line from @TheGaryBusey:  “I am an angel in an earth suit.” Do you agree? #CelebApprentice
.@Omarosa has another meltdown … while giving a check for $40000 to Michael’s charity the Sue Duncan Center. #CelebApprentice
The Paley Center for Media is a great place to visit when you’re in NYC. #CelebApprentice

.@latoyajackson informs @ArsenioHall  that @Omarosa is a “conniving witch”—is he surprised? Are we surprised? #CelebApprentice
.@Omarosa’s emergency has put a new spin on Team Power’s presentation—but it’s not “show time” yet. #CelebApprentice
.@Omarosa’s new name via @DennisRodman: “Ms. Saboteur” sounds rather elegant. #CelebApprentice
.@Omarosa is not winning points being called “the wicked witch of the Mid-West” and most certainly other things. #CelebApprentice
.@DennisRodman re @Omarosa is right she’s becoming predictable.
True @THEGaryBusey is a scene stealer without trying. He’s got a gift. #CelebApprentice
I will not be commenting on boardroom specifics- would be unfair to the different time zones. #CelebApprentice

Terrible economic numbers released today. US GDP only grew 0.4% during Oct-Dec 2012 quarter http://t.co/i8pTLtCMf3 Great news for China.
Employees of @NYMag should have their resumes updated. It is very boring &amp; will die in the near future. How much are they losing now?

Please help @autismspeaks with their petition to the White House for a national strategy for the autism epidemic http://t.co/wfD6wmF1uF
Take the time to be thorough in whatever you undertake. Remain open to new ideas. Remain fluid not fixed in your expectations.

This week’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC features another memorable Board Room rumble between @piersmorgan &amp; @OMAROSA.
Wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.
Achievers go for the challenge so the next deal is what they're thinking about. They have an obligation to best themselves.
Find out who and what is the best in your field. Identify the trendsetters leaders and authorities. Learn the standards they follow.
Have a great Good Friday and a Happy Easter.
Current @NYMag really sad not only boring but highly inaccurate. Use better paper product - looks like a death march (which it is!).
@GenaLeeNolin  Thank you GLN!
@gramma421   Not recent long term support for the autism community.
North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.
What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING!
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.
No I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad.

BIG NIGHT on Celebrity Apprentice tonight. IMPORTANT starts at 10 P.M. as scheduled but NBC just increased all future episodes to 2 hours!

Get ALL the info  then quick trial then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people! Do not be kind.
You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!
Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).
Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?
Great job by the FBI Boston Police and all others involved-start the trial tonight!
@cjdew67  Thanks!
@Lumberportal  That's great!
Sorry  the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost. Also fragrance is amazing. GO TO MACY'S.
@PierceCorey   Great going!
Oh no they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t
I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
"I hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as ""the suspect""."
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killings-maimings
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
You are right the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
@NextLevelStoner   Great!
Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9. It will be a full two hour show!

@CoachClintSwan  Tell me what were they doing in the Park playing checkers?
Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms legs and worse!
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
Great sportscaster Al Michaels a friend of mine played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National LA. He was in perfect shape!
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.

I just sent @THEGaryBusey a check of $20000 for his charity Children's Kawasaki Disease . He worked hard and deserves it.
@richardroeper Keep dreaming!
@harry_vickers @DannyZuker @ApprenticeNBC Thanks!
@SiegristA  Thanks!

Housing prices are up in Feb over last Feb 9.3 per cent -remember I told everyone two years ago to buy (but they will be going much higher)

What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.
If Jon Stewart is so above it all &amp; legit why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz? He should be proud of his heritage!
Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it.
As I’ve said many times before Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is highly overrated.

Sexual assault and rape in the Armed Forces is a Massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about-the big dark secret!

The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice one of the biggest hits in T.V. history.
@Lord_Sugar can't hold a.candle to Donald.Trump - he is a laughing stock in Great Britain (but his show pays me lots of money so I'm happy)

Just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact the stoppers have become the abusers.

According to Bill O'Reilly 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.
Sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.
When it comes to violent crime and if we are going to solve the problem we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!
Likewise the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities. These people want LAW AND ORDER now!

Snowden is sitting in China and taunting the U.S. He is mocking us as a Country. Great time to place a tax on China trade if not turned over
Snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and U.S.prestige. China is laughing at us as he continues illegal action
All I can say is that if I were President Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology!

Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman who has been a total failure in office failed to report the 98% approval rating of students for courses
Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman after years of looking file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No case!
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?
Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? Also recent asks?
How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!
"After years of long stops then starts why did dopey Eric Scheiderman tell people in The Trump Org. ""this case is going awaywe have no case"
What did our very stupid &amp; ineffective A.G. Eric Schneidean during his trips to MY office tell me about President Obama &amp; Governor Cuomo?
Wow l just found out that A.G. Schneiderman met with President Obama in Syracuse on Thursday --- and sued me on Saturday! Same as IRS etc.

Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions? We will find out.
"The lightweight hack Schneiderman told Ivanka that the “case is weak"" and more.  Meets with Obama &amp; then files one day later."
There has been a systematic targeting of the Tea Party by the Obama administration. Now Schneiderman goes after me. No coincidence.

@sonnset2  So true not even close.
Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington. He doesn't want to detract from his press &amp; glory.
I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement!
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise?
That said the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess not us.We should start rebuilding our own country &amp; military.
@walaa_3ssaf   No dopey I would not go into Syria but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.
I wonder what the great generals like Patton the big M or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia) as they say in the movies SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!
Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?
The United States needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first!

Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria? Our leaders don't know what they are doing!
If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the U.S. will look very bad!
"How bad has our ""leader"" made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize."
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack!
"Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our ""talk"" - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing!"
"Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the ""PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR"""
"Obama now just wants to save face Russia is now telling him ""don't do it"". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared."
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-&amp; laugh at us!
Be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.

The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid
Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared!

The Russians are playing a very smart game. In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous!
This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian government-and makes Obama and U.S. look hopelessly bad. President in trouble!
Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama.
Will be covering President Obama's speech at 9.00 on Twitter-you are all so lucky!
Here we go!
Does he look sharp smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
Bottom line I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin a very dangerous lifeline at that!
Wow Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner and both lost. For a while when Spitzer was way up it seemed that I was a lone voice! Good power

The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!
Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself. The so-called rebels must be thoroughly confused!
Assad hit the jackpot!
Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see worse than Spitzer or Weiner
Spitzer and Weiner lost lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next - he will be challenged in the PRIMARY. He has done a really poor job!
I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. I fought him when others retreated out of fear. NEVER GIVE UP!
Putin is having such a good time. Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. Do not fearwe are a NATION OF POTENTIAL

Success tip: Be ready for problems and be patient--there are very few cases of instant gratification.
Being successful requires nothing less than 100% of your concentrated effort. Be totally focused.
Leadership: Whatever happens you're responsible. If it doesn't happen you're responsible.
I'm in Moscow for Miss Universe tonight - picking a winner is very hard they are all winners. Total sellout of arena. Big night in Russia!
I was just given a great tour of Moscow - fantastic hard working people. CITY IS REALLY ENERGIZED! The World will be watching tonight!
I just got back from Russia-learned lots &amp; lots. Moscow is a very interesting and amazing place! U.S. MUST BE VERY SMART AND VERY STRATEGIC.
I will be on Fox &amp; Friends tomorrow morning at 7.ºº
Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!
If we could force Russia China and other competitors to use ObamaCare we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success!
Drew Brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!
If Justice Roberts had done the right thing and voted against ObamaCare our country would be in a lot better shape right now! TOTAL TURMOIL
The Republicans must be patient and smart - ObamaCare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible!
While I was in Moscow I see that President Obsma apologized for his lie I mean statement on ObamaCare! How nice of him to be so forthright
Don't worry when our country starts hurting bad enough from all of the mistakes that are being made we will start doing the right things.
WE WILL ONLY BE THE LAND OF THE FREE AS LONG AS WE ARE HOME OF THE BRAVE!
Happy Veterans Day to ALL in particular to the haters and losers who have no idea how lucky they are!!!

ObamaCare is one of the worst political disasters of all time - 4992343 AMERICANS LOSING COVERAGE LESS THAN 50OOO NEW SIGNUPS.
President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare. His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare.
ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered!
No matter how far down a path you go if it's the wrong path turn around and go back home - before it is too late.
Can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the ObamaCare website is not a US citizen—she’s from Colombia.
The same people that built the ObamaCare website used as the face of the website someone who is not a US citizen. Incompetent.

13 BILLION 4.5 BILLION-these are the stupid settlements that J.P.Morgan just made. Why don't they FIGHT? No wonder they keep getting sued.
The real J.P.Morgan is spinning in his grave at the ridiculous settlements the bank is making to settle disputes. A settler is a soft target
I wonder what the late great Vince Lombardi would say about the Rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled?
Football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatoryracist and can be viewed as bullying
I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?
The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare.
How did the NCAA which is weak and becoming irrelevant extract such a big &amp; reputation shattering settlement from Penn State. Others zero!
I will be going to Trump National Doral in Miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new Blue Monster. AMAZING!

John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate dealsthey just go on to the next one

President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Another U.S. loss!
The U.S. cannot negotiate with terrorists. It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved but this can only lead to disaster.
At some point Sgt. Bergdahl will have to explain his capture. In 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon. Many questions!
The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News.

Entrepreneurs:  If you cannot handle the tough times you will never be successful in business. Stay positive &amp; stay strong!
Entrepreneurs: Keep your momentum going! It's a big factor in sustaining your success. Keep moving forward!
That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!
Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl. #OrangeRoom
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. Solders died looking for him. U.S. should NEVER have made the deal! PUNISHMENT?
Great deal we swap 5 killer terrorists for a U.S. military deserter. That’s how the U.S. negotiates nowadays.
President said we would never leave a soldier behind. How about the 4 who died in Benghazi?
Because of our terrible leaders it is now open season on every American throughout the world. Terrorists are thrilled.

Was Susan Rice told to lie about Bergdahl? Obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything from ObamaCare to a deserter.
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?
Obama never consulted with Congress about a prisoner exchange. HE BROKE THE LAW AND SHOULD BE TRIED. OUR PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!

Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
"Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq take over the country &amp; oil and ""O"" will say thanks"

ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
Despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader this would not be the case
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite you would still be having the riots right now!
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
Sadly because president Obama has done such a poor job as president you won't see another black president for generations!
Our country is totally fractured and with our weak leadership in Washington you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places

Mitt did the right thing—not because he had to-- but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco

I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon.
When I broadly proclaimed Mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah he’s right.
Now that Mitt is gone all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run—and we will win!

Wow 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough and fast! Thugs must be stopped.
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
"The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters ""space to destroy"" - another real genius!"
Our country has to come together. We have to start working with and really liking  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.
President Obama you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership it can be done! Do it.
The best social program by far is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.
Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!
I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?
I am going to Iowa today - sold out crowds. People don't want our country ripped-off anymore. Must stop now!

Billions of dollars spent on Baltimore and it's still a total mess. Leadership is needed not dollars. Our whole country is going to hell!
Why is no-one talking about the horrible murder of Ana Charle by ex-con thug West Spruill. Gunned down on street naked. Why no riots here?
If the working proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views the U.S. as we know it is doomed!

In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!
Captured or not all our soldiers are heroes!
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
All he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything.
I will make this right for our great Vets!
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas @GregAbbott_TX for taking a tough &amp; bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry.

The ever dwindling @WSJ which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically. Who cares!
We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.

"It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me. They couldn’t care less about “inclusion"""
This story is no longer about John McCain it’s about our horribly treated vets. Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.
Look how small the pages have become @WSJ. Looks like a tabloid—saving money I assume!
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc.
Wow new @ABCnews/@WashingtonPost @GOP preference poll has DonaldTrump 11 points up! Thank you.

Good luck to my new friends on your testimony in DC. You are amazing people doing something so important--- stopping illegal immigration!

New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32% highest number yet.The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
As I have long stated we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down. Get smart U.S.A.
Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.

.@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation she is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration!
I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!
"In a clumsy move to get out of his ""anchor babies"" dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed ASIANS"
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!
"Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ""fence."" It's not a fence Jeb it's a WALL and there's a BIG difference!"
.@GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York. If he ran again he would have lost in a landslide. He and Graham ZERO in polls
Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC. You just got 4 points in your home state of SC—far better than zero nationally. You’re only 26 pts behind me.

Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll. Also my favorability numbers went up at a record almost unheard of clip. Thank you Iowa!
Huma Abedin the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener was a major security risk as a collector of info

150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information. More sensitive when she was Sec.of State. This is a very big deal.
Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this? Too bad!
The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists &amp; special interests. Bad system.
While millions are being spent against me in attack ads they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates. I am self funding.
Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!
No more Clintons or Bushes! https://t.co/bHz4Etnhw7
Many Super Pacs funded by groups that want total control over their candidate are being formed to “attack” Trump. Remember when u see them
I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so but hope it is appreciated by the voters.
Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on. He spent $430 million and lost ALL races. A dope who said Romney won election
Every Poll has me winning BIG.If you listen to dopey Karl Rove a Trump hater on @oreillyfactor you would think I'm doing poorly. @FoxNews
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1000000 contribution. I said no way!
When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1000000 they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been

.@MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!
The Dallas event in two weeks at the American Airlines Center is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast  before it is too late!
"Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman Abu Bake al-Baghdad Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical ""gotcha"" questions"
"Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN. He is just a 3rd rate ""gotcha"" guy!"
"Just announced that because of ""Trump"" advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200000 a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?"
"Saudi Arabia was ""vehemently"" against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?"
Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact it wasn't even see through glass it was black
Hillary said such nasty things about me read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion no truth. Just can't read speeches!
Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED
By self-funding my campaign I am not controlled by my donors special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!
The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!

The phony Club For Growth which asked me in writing for $1000000 (I said no) is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!
Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision not someone like Hillary or Barack neither of which has a clue!
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday1 P.M.in front of the Capitol to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran.
.@club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1000000. When I said no they came out against me. A scam operation?
Thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @FoxNews. I am with the Evangelicals and Tea Party big time. We will all WIN  together!
Remember I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. Then Dallas on Sept.14 at 6:00 P.M. American Air Center
Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C. on Wednesday (1:00 P.M. at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal!
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.

"The lobbyists &amp; special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me ""just a little"" but is very false!"
Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!

My plan will lower taxes for our country not raise them. Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie.
.@club4growth asked me for $1 million. I said no. Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes. I’ll lower big league for middle class.
Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night. Spectacular crowd &amp; arena! Thank you @mcuban.
The polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist &amp; special interest $ being spent against me. I’m turning down millions.

Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
If I would have challenged the man the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!

There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
I have been leading big in all  polls with two more today @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next  at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
I am attracting the biggest crowds by far and the best poll numbers also by far.   Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!
We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN maybe better than ever before!
Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP virtually destroying both companies that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.

Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or very weak on stopping illegal immigration. Only changed when poll numbers crashed.
Hope we all enjoy  @60Minutes tomorrow night. I do believe they will treat me fairly!

Prediction: Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him-- he will announce soon. 1%!
I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1%--his supporters come over to me. I will do a much better job for them.
Definitely watch @Carl_C_Icahn ‘s ‘Danger Ahead’. Very insightful particularly on how corp inversions hurt America: http://t.co/PJN89SwvTF

Great! https://t.co/Je440dDZbs
I watched lightweight Senator  Marco Rubio who is all talk and no action defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration. Pathetic!
"Just read that ""Trump"" has the largest (and I add most enthusiastic) crowds. Tonight I will be in New Hampshire - the place will be packed!"
Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests. A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate. Lazy!

Thank you Iowa! Great night---see you soon! #Trump2016 https://t.co/aCHH90cNRg
After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!
.@CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers. Number one based on every statistic is Trump (by a wide margin). They just can't say it!
.@Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa. @politico is a scam!
Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious  polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate. Sad!
I'm sure the media will not report the highly respected new national poll that just came out via The Economist. 32%! https://t.co/aalSqnGHa3
.@TheEconomist Poll one of the most highly respected was just released. Wow wait until the media digests these numbers - won't be happy!
@CNBC  POLL  TOTAL: TRUMP 25.22  CARSON 19.78  RUBIO 9.67....
"Via @MailOnline ""Trump still in the lead by a whopping 14 points after fluke survey had put Carson on top""-  https://t.co/tfaOARLoZb"
Thanks everyone they all said  I won the debate. Even won the @CNBC Poll!
Thank you! #GOPDebate MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/u6bJBPu30T https://t.co/UB8XqapdzZ

My interview on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had a 40%+ ratings increase over same Sunday last year. 20% over last week.
Wow just heard really bad stuff about the failing  @politico. How much longer  will they be around? Some very untalented reporters.
Loved doing the debate last night on @CNBC. Check out all of the polls! Everyone agrees that Harwood bombed!
Thank you @CharlesHurt for  the nice words on @seanhannity. I will win and Make America Great Again!
Thank you @Morning_Joe for explaining to @CNN and @andersoncooper and so many others that I am leading in almost all national &amp; state polls.
Happy Birthday to my wonderful daughter @IvankaTrump.
Thank you @rushlimbaugh for your wonderful words. We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

When candidate John Kasich on the @oreillyfactor talked about dismantling Medicare and Medicaid he was referring to Ben Carson.
I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid Carson wants to abolish and failing candidate Gov. John Kasich doesn't have a clue - weak!
Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event. She looked lost. This is not what we need with ISIS CHINA RUSSIA etc.
The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!). EVERY other poll had me #1.
"I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac which are total scams. Marco must address him as ""SIR""!"
I am leaving for Norfolk Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd. See you soon!
I told you so-@politico just lost it's top person. Poor results and no money to pay him. If they were legit they would be doing far better!
Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk. See ya'
The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me. They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them. Look forward to it!
.@ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show @TheHerd on Monday (2:30pm EST).

Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words. All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd). Explain to Daniel Henninger!
No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them? Interesting question!
Few people know that  @FortuneMagazine is still in business. Tell your writer  Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president
".@thehill  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. I said ""NO THANKS"" Waste of time &amp; energy!"
Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time &amp; money!
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's Mr. Amnesty endorsement.Rubs can't win
"Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio  READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8"""
"Jeb's new slogan - ""Jeb can fix it"". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message the word ""fix"" is not a good one to use in politics!"
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
"Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a ""lightweight""."
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.

Also tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.
"Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio ""he's my friend!"" Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say ""disloyal guy no friend!"""
".@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ""ran for president twice."" Never ran merely considered running!"
Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame! https://t.co/O9Kgfi5xcH
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
"Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson ""is trying to solidify his lead."" But I am #1 easily! Sad"
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
"Carson now admits his friend named ""Bob"" who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!) no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!"
I think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @GovChristie &amp; @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate. Both solid &amp; good guys. @FoxBusiness

"All seven on-line polls including Drudge and Time with thousands of respondents said I won the debate. @krauthammer said I was ""so so."""
I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30
Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.
.@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.
The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.
"When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want ""smart"" trade deals."
Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!
We as a country either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
.@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%
Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?

.@CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize?
.@CarlyFiorina  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper &amp; pathological disease. I didn’t say it he did. Apology?
.@CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room. Separate pieces—great ratings!

Hillary and Sanders are not doing well but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.

I think everyone will like my new and very successful book Crippled America. Go get it and let me know what you think!
When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He  can't say it and unless he will  the problem will not be solved!

Governor Kasich whose failed campaign &amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easy—he came in dead last!
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last.
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete &amp; total dud!
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!

We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States. Too bad but New York City will survive!
To show you how politicians act Bobby Jindal spent $1000 to register in New Hampshire &amp; dropped out the next day. Such a waste!
Heading to Birmingham Alabama and a massive crowd of incredible people! 12 noon - will be wild.
A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker - a wacko - now trying to raise funds to fight me.

.ccolvinj @AP is one of the truly bad reporters---working for an organization that has totally lost its way. Stories are fictional garbage.

Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration among many other things. She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!
.@MatthewJDowd thank you for the nice comments recently especially on @BarbaraJWalters. My family &amp; I greatly appreciate your kind words.
.@AP continues to do extremely dishonest reporting. Always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working!
.@AP has one of the worst reporters in the business -- @JeffHorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face.
Going to Columbus Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. The silent majority is no longer silent!

The failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump!
The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb
So since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade why do people care what they write. Incompetent!
The numbers at the @nytimes  are so dismal especially advertising revenue that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD!
Happy Thanksgiving to all. Have a great day and look forward to the future. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!
Virtually no-one has spent more money in helping the  American people with disabilities than me. Will discuss today at my speech in Sarasota
We boarded the helicopter for Sarasota earlier &amp; will be landing soon! See you there. #Trump2016 https://t.co/x4RbbKXHCu

The Sarasota Florida rally today was amazing. 12000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen this is a MOVEMENT!
I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning. So much to talk about!
.@CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring
Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC. Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. Just another sad case
Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors. Many I know-wonderful people! Not a press event.
After my meeting with the pastors it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there a beautiful movement!
Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC. You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are. You will be right!
When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis who doesn't have a clue! Others bad also.
Wow the MSM is really going after me. 12000 in Sarasota a love fest hardly a mention. Only one negativity - they only want negatives!
How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ which is deeply troubled when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A.M. Should be interesting - ENJOY!
"Hillary just said that she will not use the term ""radical Islamic"" - but was incapable of saying why. She is afraid of  Obama &amp; the e-mails!"

So how did I do on Face The Nation?

BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT. I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P.M. ( EASTERN). MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!
I will be re-tweeting some of your better most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. Make them good (great)! Important stuff.
Hillary won't call out radical Islam! She will be soundly defeated.
The podium in the Oval Office looks odd! Not good but the words will be the key.
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!
Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!
Wish Obama would say ISIS like almost everyone else rather than ISIL.
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
Well Obama refused to say (he just can't say it) that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
Thank you Graham Ledger of the Daily Ledger @OANN for your really fair coverage and your great interview with Peter Roff of U.S. NEWS &amp; W.R.
Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes. What sport is he talking about and who? Is Obama profiling?
"I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group many friends in D.C. I said ""I'm a negotiator like you"" Got standing O-rated best of day!"
N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States. I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets the homeless and crime! Disgrace

Respected Morning Consult poll just out. I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin- 45 to 40!
.@BernardGoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor. He just doesn't know about winning! But he is a nice guy.
Great evening last night in  New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory great people! Thank you.
.@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also I beat Hillary easily!
Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so he will fall like all others. Will be easy!
.@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
.@Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out waste of time
.@chucktodd is a nice guy  but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and in particular winning!  I fixed his rating problem.

Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' &amp; PA Governor. Him &amp; his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!

Something must be done with dopey @KarlRove - he is pushing Republicans down the same old path of defeat. Don't fall for it Karl is a loser
.@Peggynoonannyc Interesting article but I will beat Hillary easily. People that have given up on the system will come out to vote for me!
.@Peggynoonannyc An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U.S. history. Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M.

.@danawhite  Great job last night - very exciting! You have come a long way from those difficult early days I am proud of you.
A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead. Nice!
Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry home of The Duel In The Sun will be the worlds best after the renovation.
I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair. He then puts on Rove Lane and Will three Trump bashers to discuss.
I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back get caught and then deny it. Well welcome to the wonderful world of politics!
People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!

Wow I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13% 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it
Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press
.@megynkelly the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!
.@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.
I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!
I am in Trump International Hotel Las Vegas getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward -   hope I get treated fairly!
Between Iraq war monger @krauthammer dummy @KarlRove deadpan @GeorgezWill highly overrated @megynkelly among others @FoxNews not fair!

.@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!
My friend @AriEmanuel of @IMG bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #Fox! Tune in!

Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!
"Hillary said at debate ISIS is ""going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst."" She made up story-want apology!"
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.
"Hillary said with respect to ISIS ""we are finally where we need to be."" Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!"

Weak and low energy @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.
.@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!
Will @JebBush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
Why doesn't @JebBush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate?
.@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent.
Women defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rally.VIDEO: https://t.co/yreUny7shA https://t.co/dE9odwIRQi
Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
Jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
"Once again #MSM is dishonest. ""Schlonged"" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got ""schlonged"" that meant beaten badly."
"NPR's @NealConan said ""schlonged"" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: ""That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls."" #Hypocrisy"
"For those on TV defending my use of the word ""schlonged"" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM"
Wow new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/TUDwrg6RsD
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
We need a PRESIDENT with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!

The @washingtonpost which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad
.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
"Hillary when you complain about ""a penchant for sexism"" who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!"

Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone) I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - SO SAD!
Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3% I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
I am now in Palm Beach Florida and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!
Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
We have many problems in our house (country!) and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop I will fix this quickly!
"When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say ""we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it?"" Never!"
@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless however if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!
.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
The same people that said I wouldn't run or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%) now say I won't beat Hillary.
The Phoenix V.A. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous and people are dying. I will fix it
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Story: https://t.co/PBOKbGIaVB https://t.co/wm9Y7E9RzB

Thank you! #Trump2016https://t.co/CE9f0mukFm https://t.co/XNV9Bg2ccY
I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!
The middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. We now are part time sad! I WILL FIX!
Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes while he will double &amp; triple them a disaster!

.@JebBush has spent  $63000000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!  @hughhewitt
"People ask ""why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls?"" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!"

I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son @DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you! #TBT https://t.co/ULerCEOCGX https://t.co/nbxPVdarJM
THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family &amp; friends- out to VOTE IN 2016! https://t.co/lg5kMbNLYK https://t.co/dtMAsIq4cf
Do you believe that The State Department on NEW YEAR'S EVE just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!
I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO FINALLY MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!
I will be on @FoxNews live  with members of my family at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Well the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.
The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is by far me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!
Thank you so much to https://t.co/8OMryrUVET for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me!

.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!
".@JebBush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!"
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better!
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
Remember I am self-funding my campaign the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
Heading to Biloxi Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support! #VoteTrump2016 https://t.co/1VMngEMLzT
Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening!
Thank you #Biloxi #Mississippi! Remember this night &amp; spread the word to get out &amp; #VoteTrump2016! https://t.co/hfYdkY5DKq
Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
Al-Shabbab not ISIS just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp; if I speak out against them which I must. Hillary lied!
Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
Thank you for your support in Biloxi MS! Let's ALL get out &amp; VOTE in 2016 so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/RSZF12Kyhn
Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton in 2008 worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.
".@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that ""attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before."" Wrong - attacked him in '08 &amp; won!"
.@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying
Iran with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia &amp; their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.
By the way Hillary &amp; the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video. https://t.co/gRannsRXJr
I look forward to being in Lowell Massachusetts today. I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!
Woody Johnson owner of the NYJets is @JebBush’s finance chairman. If Woody would’ve been w/me he would’ve been in the playoffs at least!
The rally in Lowell Massachusetts was amazing. 10000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75000 to around 10—bad management. No wonder they begged me for ads.
I don’t know @SamuelLJackson to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him &amp; think he does too many TV commercials—boring. Not a fan.

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come first serve. Arrive early!
I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.
Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them just received: https://t.co/NucdHBZAH9
The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid how desperate!
.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P last year plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
I will be in beautiful Burlington Vermont tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!
Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early!
.@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
Weak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!
Hillary and her friends! https://t.co/q45tTapqMI
The @TheView @ABC once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!
Joy Behar who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara!
I'm leaving now for Burlington Vermont. It will be wild!
We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! https://t.co/NHPdGm57YJ
Great time in Burlington Vermont. Crowd was amazing.
Hank Greenberg formerly of AIG gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy a total waste of money!

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!
Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!
I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!
Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!
In the just out @FoxNews Poll I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Heading now for Reno Nevada for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!
Remember get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. https://t.co/DL8hDPzHoi
If their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isn’t questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters try getting a new publisher!

The #SOTU speech is really boring slow lethargic - very hard to watch!
Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice but OK! New polls are great.
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them ridiculously billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!

Why does @CNN &amp; @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures &amp; images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaignhis booketc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
"Ted Cruz said he ""didn't know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable"
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there!
Oh no just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan this one from Citi. Wow no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
"Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a ""natural born Canadian"" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?"
Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
Great new numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016https://t.co/Z1lQdxQvRL https://t.co/GFYNUWWCYn
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money does another for votes. https://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form &amp; not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! https://t.co/m98wooUwsG https://t.co/izBMhEZolh

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.
.@BrentBozell one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was until recently a Canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!
Heading to Sioux County Iowa where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again!
Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6000000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
.@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6000000 for our VETS!

"The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters ""in violation."" They are now under investigation. Bad!"
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!
Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal &amp; replace. He lies!
"By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing ""unfairness"" - while raising $6000000 for VETS."
If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $6000000.

It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!
".@Morning_Joe  @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"""
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! #FITN #Trump2016 https://t.co/oUg1ErD0j7 https://t.co/9Hb7JO3wrZ
Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
"And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie!"
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
Cruz just lied again- I am and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
"Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for ""deceit and dirty tricks and lies."""

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp; ill-informed ads.
Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!
If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act stop cheating &amp; doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time he is out!
Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush are now running in S.C.

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.
The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!
Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington &amp; Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!
Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot &amp; I hold liberal positions. LIES!
Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.https://t.co/SnOnu6IHTC https://t.co/f0C429tvHO

How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!
All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge TIME etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!

Hey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate

Even though every poll Time Drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!

Loved the debate last night and almost everyone said I won but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses!
Wow in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
Ted Cruz along with Jeb Bush pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice but didn't!
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy now brother!
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG BIG BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue &amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
Jeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)https://t.co/eiBCld77tV

.@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it!
Thank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon
Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn!
"Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I ""would never be president"" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!"
.@lindseygraham who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.
I will beat Hillary easily but Lindsey Graham says I won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
.@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1% he should take his dumb mouthpiece @LindseyGrahamSC and just go home.
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper &amp; have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.
I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety &amp; replace it w/ something much better.
I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts &amp; allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice &amp; freedom for consumer.
I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
Remember Cruz and Bush gave us Roberts who upheld #ObamaCare twice! I am the only one who will #MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in. Don't allow it
South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today) and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I am in Las Vegas at the best hotel (by far) Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR and Evangelicals do not like liars!
I hear the Rickets family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful they have a lot to hide!
Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.
"Ted Cruz does not have the right ""temperment"" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!"
Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out &amp; said no!

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.
Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam his house sale &amp; his no show voting!
Marco Rubio lost big last night. I even beat him in Virginia where he spent so much time and money. Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
My wife @MELANIATRUMP will be #OnTheRecord w/ @greta tonight at 7pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy! https://t.co/yxrRkJJSGG https://t.co/Trv1hj9hRI
Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger stronger party!
.@CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump. Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty. Love it!
I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here: https://t.co/WwIVhIud06

Because of me the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters a record. If they are not careful they will all leave. Sad!
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio &amp; Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger!
"Failed candidate Mitt Romneywho ran one of the worst races in presidential historyis working with the establishment to bury a big ""R"" win!"
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who as a Senator never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke!
"I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of ""Trump"""
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. Easy win
Go to Trump Doral in Miami and watch the World Golf Championship! On NOW!

To the people of Kentucky Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure. #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

.@meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false. Dishonest media!
All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS the bandits that tell your pols what to do
How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook &amp; Twitter. Watch!
Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty!
Lindsey Graham is all over T.V. much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty angry jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!
We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT who could not stop Obama (twice) ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!
I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate he is scamming Florida
Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish!
Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd will be fun!
Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people!
It was great being in Michigan. Remember I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco his State Chairman &amp; their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true
Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem!
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie or my supporters will go to yours!
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying!
Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @GolfChannel
Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party Republican wins will be massive! https://t.co/1rmyCGSlsV
Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!https://t.co/08xkEBD8Be
Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- &amp; should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will bring our jobs back to America fix our military and take care of our vets end Common Core and ObamaCare protect 2nd A build WALL
Please remember I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
Don't reward Mitt Romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA open borders etc.).

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate until I put him down.
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
In presidential voting so far John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him I will beat Hillary!
"I will bring our jobs back to the U.S. and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will ""sing"" again."
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
Word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people big &amp; over!

I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor
Stuart Stevens the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!
Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
".@WSJ Editorial says ""Clinton primary vote total is 8646551.Trump's is 7533692""-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize"
.@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!
Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won according to Drudge etc. all 11 of them!
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. https://t.co/HiOhRaTMbm
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine!

Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
.@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
Club For Growth tried to extort $1000000 from me. When I said NO they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!

"Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney the man who ""choked"" and let us all down is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!"
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich &amp; Marco Rubio and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2

.@AndreaTantaros- You are a true journalistic professional. I so agree with what you say. Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you- Tucson Arizona! A great afternoon with 6000 supporters! #VoteTrump on Tuesday!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/CTgYrLnAWV
THANK YOU ARIZONA! Get out and #VoteTrump on Tuesday! #AZPrimary #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/5itxkQxrLF
The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.
Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy!
Why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media? SAD!
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!
So the highly overrated anchor @megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but I can't fight back? Wrong!
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!
Wow President Obama just landed in Cuba a big deal and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
Watch this clip from earlier this year. Time &amp; time again I have been right about terrorism. It’s time to get tough! https://t.co/8mnY3GFRzw
My heart &amp; prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #Brussels tragedy. This madness must be stopped and I will stop it.

Obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame.
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately &amp; get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful Lyin' Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife!
Incompetent Hillary despite the horrible attack in Brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!
Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain https://t.co/VMCzxrryG8
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you I will never forget!
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Thank you Arizona! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrainhttps://t.co/MMPR0Omwog https://t.co/Dgqky0JiHO
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
I will be the best by far in fighting terror. I’m the only one that was right from the beginning &amp; now Lyin’ Ted &amp; others are copying me.
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate and the time is now!
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
.@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS do nothing!
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!
"Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a ""hell hole"" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!"
It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO!
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
".@TheView T.V. show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM ""NO"""
Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem!
Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad!
Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz- https://t.co/c3QEbexOwT
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/PHgrT1Nl27
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story!
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence Lyin' Ted!
Wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot?
Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking. Weak leaders ridiculous laws!
The media is so after me on women  Wow this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story!
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out!
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S. jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
Remember I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others!
I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy!
Wow sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now finally receiving plaudits!
Happy Easter to all have a great day!
Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women &amp; children. At least 67 dead400 injured. I alone can solve
Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS!
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming
See Lyin' Ted even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio not Trump! https://t.co/Okc8XajVnz
The United States cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!
Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story via the Gateway Pundit: https://t.co/batAmur1FD
"A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called ""leaders"" ever learn!"
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must!
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President!
After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb Rand Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me!
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak &amp; losing big so now he wants to debate again. But according to DrudgeTime and on-line polls I have won all debates
Lyin' Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs &amp; illegal imm!
We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games we must be smart tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN &amp; MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
Wow @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
How come the @TODAYshow &amp; @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? https://t.co/qbW2RjkINX

The Club For Growthwhich asked me for $1000000 in an extortion attempt just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again!
The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical &amp; economic threat facing the American people!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if I win all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!

Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president. Based on her decision making ability I can go along with that!
A great honor to visit the 9/11 Memorial Museum with my wife @MELANIATRUMP today. #NewYorkValues https://t.co/eKCEWRD0Ro
The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them. We are the suckers-no more!
I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning Staten Island. Big crowd will be fun!
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!
I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
New York we will make America great again! https://t.co/KyxbaW4fsL

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today. Amazing job!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton. I will win!
.@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight. Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!
.@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN  @jaketapper  Thank you!
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally. Things are looking good for Tuesday!
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!
Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

I will be in Evansville Indiana with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there!

Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton who wants to destroy all miners I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs!
"Governor Rick Perry said ""Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen."" Thank you Rick!"
So many great endorsements yesterday except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special the Republican Party. Wrong I didn't inherit it I won it with millions of voters!
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:https://t.co/lSDE7LHc95
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton’s flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?

Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”
Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump &amp; gets nothing done in Senate?
In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.

Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use
Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!
Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.
That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer who said it was a lie!
Wow Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
"A political commentator for @cnn which I no longer watch said ""Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries."" I set all-time record!"
With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!
"Thank you Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ ""The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump""  https://t.co/xm45Ia1GTu"
Rowanne Brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends. https://t.co/qkK3LJPoQQ
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false malicious &amp; libelous story they did on me.
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements.
The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond.
In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.
Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
"The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. ""You can tell them to go BLANK themselves"" - was about China NOT WOMEN!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!

Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre Chris Cox &amp; the @NRA! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/aJ7s0aqqj0

@montgomeriefdn  Colin great to have you at Trump Turnberry. So proud of you and your GREAT playing! You made winning MAJORS look easy!
"Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that ""the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain."""
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment. No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person!
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the TSA is falling apart just like our government! Airports a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary!
.@CNN is so negative getting even worse as I get closer. Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. Turning off!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/MAZK5bdZuD
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. You are our true heroes! #ArmedForcesDay https://t.co/A3Wus0cRIO
Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!
Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

While under no obligation to do so I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our VETERANS. Nice!
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
Amazingly with all of the money I have raised for the vets I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
I just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary. Read it &amp; you will never be able to vote for her. @Ed_Klein https://t.co/ujDwSSFhbx

Great rally in New Mexico amazing crowd! Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American is a lowlife!
@elizabethforma  Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes known as Pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!
Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk no action!
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!
Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
Thank you Anaheim California!#Trump2016 https://t.co/AEShamhNVS

The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- &amp; I'm beating her.
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez!
I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!
The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
In getting the endorsement of the 16500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you) the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
The endorsement of me by the 16500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent instead of sixteen. Broke record
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego) who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge Gonzalo Curiel who is totally biased against me.
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today Trump Tower!
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5600000 that I raised/gave!
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
So I raised/gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased.

Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego I have thousands of great reviews &amp; will win case!
After the litigation is disposed of and the case won I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?) so much interest in it! I will be pres.

I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!
In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!

The Clinton News Network sometimes referred to as @CNN is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors
I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. We can be great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good flexible save money and number one!

Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters because of trade will come to me.
As expected the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but just like our big wins in the primaries we will win!
Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs the economy trade healthcare the military guns and just about all else. Obama plus!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State costing Americans millions of jobs.
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty &amp; judgment ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt dangerous dishonest.
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. But Hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from Hispanic &amp; African-American workers.
Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart. I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans. #Imwithyou
Obama &amp; Clinton should stop meeting with special interests &amp; start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
On immigration I’m consulting with our immigration officers&amp; our wage-earners. Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
Our inner cities have been left behind. We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
CNN which is totally biased in favor of Clinton should apologize. They knew they were wrong.  https://t.co/KR7OnS8h6s

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!
Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!
George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own: https://t.co/pr3BSHJSxL
"The ""dirty"" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good."
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate goofy Elizabeth Warren who lied on heritage.
The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) watch November
.@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I don't watch it anymore.
Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online! Watch it here: https://t.co/5mtwkOvQnd #CrookedHillary #Trump2016
Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
Yet another terrorist attack this time in Turkey. Willthe world ever realize what is going on? So sad.
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

For reasons only they can explain the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.

As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!
"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"
"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away no pictures."""
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!

I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33000 missing e-mails?"
With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
"On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. ""Special: Meet the Trumps"" Hope you enjoy!"
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual bad judgment.

"I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8 she's out!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information."" Not fit!"
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City

Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?

What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
One of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove
Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxD
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!"
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!
The @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie."
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Funny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
Bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
For the record I have ZERO investments in Russia.

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y
As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
"Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!"
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
"Our not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz!"
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety.
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction terrorism and ISIS across the world.
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream!"
Two policemen just shot in San Diego one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!

General John Allen who I never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary
Little Michael Bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary

Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
#CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp
"Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings"
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql
Crooked's stop in Johnstown Pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 - with Bill VP

"Captain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!"
I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me!
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
Wow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
Mr. Khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
This story is not about Mr. Khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
"When I said in an interview that Putin is ""not going into Ukraine you can mark it down"" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!"
So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
"Crooked Hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she ""SHORT CIRCUITED"" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!"
"Anybody whose mind ""SHORT CIRCUITS"" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word ""BRAINWASHED."""

I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!
"The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea nuclear ""the baby"" and so much more. Very dishonest!"
Michael Morell the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A. and a man who has made serious bad calls is a total Clinton flunky!

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed like Libya open borders and maybe her emails?
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
.@dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock
Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad &amp; irrelevant!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
I love watching these poor pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!

The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
The failing @nytimes which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False I am who I am-never said
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20%
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
Stay on message is the chant. I always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!
Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!

Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning  unwatchable! @morningmika is off the wall a neurotic and not very bright mess!

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds looking for a larger venue.
Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime how many more shootings will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!
Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!
Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere
Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by Bernie S she has BAD JUDGEMENT
Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want TRUMP!

Great visit to Detroit church fantastic reception and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!
.@CNN is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
Wow the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @JeffFlake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
The Great State of Arizona where I just had a massive rally (amazing people) has a very weak and ineffective Senator Jeff Flake. Sad!
The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
"To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. I will fix it VOTE ""T"""
"Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the ""C"" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?"
President Obama &amp; Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!

Thank you to our fantastic veterans. The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great. Nice!
Thank you America - great #CommanderInChiefForum polls! https://t.co/Rcu6KaRGCB
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.
COMING UP @GenFlynn @newtgingrich on @foxandfriends
Wow reviews are in - THANK YOU!
A rough night for Hillary Clinton  ABC News.
Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
With Luis Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/sCOnny1fl3
More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain https://t.co/FxyBL6fO1h
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails &amp; the veteran who said she should be in jail.
Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA https://t.co/C5ipaxUN7B
The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
.@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. Theyare a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
Henry McMaster Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers so badly. Funny!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/JIlNW7myEN

Dummy writer @tonyschwartz who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no) is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!
I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope!
Just returned from Pensacola Florida where the crowd was incredible.
Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman Phyllis S!
Wow Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters millions of amazing hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!
Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham Romney Flake Sass. SUPREME COURT REMEMBER!
While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters and while many of her supporters will never vote for me I still respect them all!
Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
The seriously failing @nytimes despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place only writes dishonest hits!

My thoughts and prayers go out to the @PhillyPolice &amp; @Penn police officers- in Philadelphia. https://t.co/eyC3W1mweY
Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
.@CNN just doesn't get it and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists mostly losers in life!
Wacky @NYTimesDowd who hardly knows me makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!
Crazy Maureen Dowd the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes pretends she knows me well--wrong!
The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything has become a laughingstock rag!
My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now) but they are watching. Really disgusting
Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses including Obama.
I would like to express my warmest regards best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!! https://t.co/5Gwi1M5R2t
Under the leadership of Obama &amp; Clinton Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook!
Terrible attacks in NY NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims their families and all Americans! We need to be strong!
Will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 A.M.  Enjoy.
Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them we don't have a country!

"Wow Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ""angel"" without checking her past which is terrible!"
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
"Remember don't believe ""sources said"" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources the sources don't exist."

Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll) it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!
Our very weak and ineffective leader Paul Ryan had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!

The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan always fighting the Republican nominee!
Paul Ryan a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago) must start focusing on the budget military vets etc.
Finally in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!
"Wow interview released by Wikileakes shows ""quid pro quo"" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person - &amp; Paul Ryan does zilch!"
Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP
ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY NORTH CAROLINA. With you all the way will never forget. Now we have to win. Proud of you all!  @NCGOP
Can't believe these totally phoney stories 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press have impact!
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!
We have all got to come together and win this election. We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!).

A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters incited by the media are protesting. Very unfair!
Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!
Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet https://t.co/wPk7QWpK8Z
This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win win win!
"Wow the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ""Trump phenomena"""
The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
Jeb Bush George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
Governor John Kasich of the GREAT GREAT GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
"The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ""more countries should acquire nuclear weapons."" How dishonest are they. I never said this!"
I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
The debates especially the second and third plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS gave us the win!
If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play. Campaigning is much different!
Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
"I am not trying to get ""top level security clearance"" for my children. This was a typically false news story."
The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia U.K. China Saudi Arabia Japan
Australia New Zealand and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
My transition team which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford Chairman of Ford who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton cameras blazing.This should not happen!
The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man Mike Pence. Apologize!
The cast and producers of Hamilton which I hear is highly overrated should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior
Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice
Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?
Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.

Fidel Castro is dead!
The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated &amp; demoralized Dems
The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
"Hillary's debate answer on delay: ""That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --"
and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -
during a general election. I for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --
"of position."" Then separately she stated ""He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of --"
"this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy."" She then said ""We have to accept the results and look to the future Donald --"
"Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad"
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
Serious voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!
If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole I will terminate deal.
Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!
.@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don't know what to do.
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however since election they are worse!
Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!

wanting to sell their product cars A.C. units etc. back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult but.....
these companies are able to move between all 50 states with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very ...

A very interesting read. Unfortunately so much is true.https://t.co/ER2BoM765M
October 2015 - thanks Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday! https://t.co/VEsgPcWq7z
I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network. ENJOY!
Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience and congrats to Army!
I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy of the Great State of Louisiana for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON!
"Whether I choose him or not for ""State""- Rex Tillerson the Chairman &amp; CEO of ExxonMobil is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!"
Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased inaccurate and bad point after point. Just can't get much worse although @CNN is right up there!
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
"Unless you catch ""hackers"" in the act it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?"
The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!
I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
Even though I am not mandated by law to do so I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the......
Presidency. Two of my children Don and Eric plus executives will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.
I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!
I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world Rex Tillerson Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil to be Secretary of State.
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.

"Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me ""Person of the Year"" - a great honor!"
The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House as it pertains to my business so complex - when actually it isn't!
If Russia or some other entity was hacking why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?
Join me in Mobile Alabama on Sat. at 3pm! #ThankYouTour2016 Tickets: https://t.co/GGgbjl8Zo6 https://t.co/opKrWO4k0C

China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.
Thank you Alabama! From now on it’s going to be #AmericaFirst. Our goal is to bring back that wonderful phrase:… https://t.co/4UAazd7TmF
We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!
If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing they would be scorned &amp; called terrible names!
Today there were terror attacks in Turkey Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!
We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
"Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He ""doesn't know much"" ..."
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states
Yes it is true - Carlos Slim the great businessman from Mexico called me about getting together for a meeting. We met HE IS A GREAT GUY!
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!
I would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently
I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people!
The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....cont: https://t.co/s8rXKKZNF1
"Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase ""DRAIN THE SWAMP"" was no longer being used by me. Actually we will always be trying to DTS."
The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35 I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!
"The so-called ""A"" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration but look what they did for Hillary NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!"
My wonderful son Eric will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with...
my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids has raised millions of dollars for them and now must stop. Wrong answer!
As to the U.N. things will be different after Jan. 20th.
"The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime ""by God's will we will slaughter you pigs I swear we will......"
slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S. and all countries fight back?
"Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ""In my opinion it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.""  So true!"
".@NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: ""until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.""  Dishonest!"
The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad but we will get it done anyway!

Merry Christmas and a very very very  very Happy New Year to everyone!
President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving ISIS OCare etc.
The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together talk and have a good time. So sad!
The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation raised or recieved millions more ALL of which is given to charity and media won't report!
The DJT Foundation unlike most foundations never paid fees rent salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7 THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!
Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!
We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S. but.......
not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel January 20th is fast approaching!

Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!
"@CNN just released a book called ""Unprecedented"" which explores the 2016 race &amp; victory. Hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!"
Various media outlets and pundits say that I thought I was going to lose the election. Wrong it all came together in the last week and.....
I thought and felt I would win big easily over the fabled 270 (306). When they cancelled fireworks they knew and so did I.
North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!
China has been taking out massive amounts of money &amp; wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade but won't help with North Korea. Nice!
General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!
"People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it ""CRAZY"""
"The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said ""The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!"" - And it is lousy healthcare."
With all that Congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog as unfair as it
........may be their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS
Instead of driving jobs and wealth away AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION &amp; JOB CREATION.https://t.co/siXrptsOrt

I will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C. Thank you.
"The ""Intelligence"" briefing on so-called ""Russian hacking"" was delayed until Friday perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!"
"Julian Assange said ""a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta"" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!"
Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning - much more to follow
"Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have ""hacking defense"" like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible......"
things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media as usual gave them a pass.
Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases......
like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web...
massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!
"Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the ""Movement"""
The Democrats lead by head clown Chuck Schumer know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it they..
"...do the typical political thing and BLAME. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning.""Keep you doctor keep your plan!"" It is...."
...time for Republicans &amp; Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive &amp; FAR BETTER!
The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states it is for the people....
"to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ""Intelligence"" when in fact I am a big fan!"
Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja Mexico to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.
"How did NBC get ""an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?"" Who gave them this report and why? Politics!"
The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia......
So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?
The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!
Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters. They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the......
and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE
Hopefully all supporters and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW!
"Wow the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ""swamped"" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine DJT. So much for...."

Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast &amp; Steven Newhouse a friend. Will go this AM.
I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.
Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!
Happy Birthday @EricTrump!https://t.co/bJaEY7qFSn
Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense!
Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!
Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
"Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. Only ""stupid"" people or fools would think that it is bad! We....."
have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President Russia will respect us far more than they do now and....
both countries will perhaps work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!
Congratulation to Jane Timken on her major upset victory in becoming the Ohio Republican Party Chair. Jane is a loyal Trump supporter &amp; star
I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain a longtime U.S. ally is very special!
Kellyanne Conway went to @MeetThePress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd. Dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes. Terrible!
Before I or anyone saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report it was leaked out to @NBCNews. So serious!
Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake!
Rupert Murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer!
Meryl Streep one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a.....

groveling when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!
It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants adding 2000 jobs. This after...

FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!
'BuzzFeed Runs Unverifiable Trump-Russia Claims' #FakeNews https://t.co/d6daCFZHNh
"Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is ""A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION UTTER NONSENSE."" Very unfair!"
Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS NO LOANS NO NOTHING!
"I win an election easily a great ""movement"" is verified and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!"
"Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ""leak"" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?"
We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today. A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on
James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up phony facts.Too bad!
Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine

Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!
All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts not mine!
It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued....
Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists. Probably...
"released by ""Intelligence"" even knowing there is no proof and never will be. My people will have a full report on hacking within 90 days!"
What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had she should never.....
have been allowed to run - guilty as hell. They were VERY nice to her. She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!
"The ""Unaffordable"" Care Act will soon be history!"
A beautiful funeral today for a real NYC hero Detective Steven McDonald. Our law enforcement community has my complete and total support.

mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk talk talk - no action or results. Sad!
"INTELLIGENCE INSIDERS NOW CLAIM THE TRUMP DOSSIER IS ""A COMPLETE FRAUD!""  @OANN"
Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!
Inauguration Day is turning out to be even bigger than expected. January 20th Washington D.C. Have fun!
The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me. With all of the jobs I am bringing back to our Nation that number..

For many years our country has been divided angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!
"Thank you to Bob Woodward who said ""That is a garbage document...it never should have been presented...Trump's right to be upset (angry)..."

The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries then the general election. FAKE NEWS!
Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its.....
...dwindling subscribers and readers.They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course and never will. DISHONEST
Today we remember the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger 31 years later. #NeverForget https://t.co/OhshQsFRfl
I will be interviewed by @TheBrodyFile on @CBNNews tonight at 11pm. Enjoy!
Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!
Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and indeed the world - a horrible mess!
Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!
The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain &amp; Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. The two...
...Senators should focus their energies on ISIS illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.

Only 109 people out of 325000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage.....
protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!
"If the ban were announced with a one week notice the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there!"

Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally  at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!

Getting ready to deliver a VERY IMPORTANT DECISION!  8:00 P.M.
Join me live from the @WhiteHouse.https://t.co/LHOs4nAaGl
Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. He is a good and brilliant man respected by all.
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!
Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!
If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?
Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State. He will be a star!
Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor. To a great and brave man - thank you!
Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!
Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion
Thank you @Samsung! We would love to have you! https://t.co/r5nxC9oOA4
Yes Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard!
"Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how ""kind"" President Obama was to them. Not me!"
Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!
Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S. health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!
Professional anarchists thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S.
"We must keep ""evil"" out of our country!"
Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!
When a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot  come in &amp; out especially for reasons of safety &amp;.security - big trouble!
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp; destruction!
The opinion of this so-called judge which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned!
After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into U.S.?
Because the ban was lifted by a judge many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision
Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. (prior to Super Bowl). Enjoy!
The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!
Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!
I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor at 4:00 P.M. (prior to the #SuperBowl Pre-game Show) on Fox Network. Enjoy!
Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!
Any negative polls are fake news just like the CNN ABC NBC polls in the election. Sorry people want border security and extreme vetting.
I call my own shots largely based on an accumulation of data and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media in order to marginalize lies!
Will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M.
The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years and now are making up stories &amp; sources!

Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately but it was clearly not....
...intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed.....

Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times and 4 times last year alone.
"Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!"

Big G7 meetings today. Lots of very important matters under discussion. First on the list of course is terrorism. #G7Taormina
Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably as they should. Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger.
I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!

It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.
Whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media and they don't mention names....
....it is very possible that those sources don't exsist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!

The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well actually ahead of schedule. Big benefits to all!
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging &amp; demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
Honoring the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to America. Home of the free because of the brave. #MemorialDay🇺🇸
North Korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor China by shooting off yet another ballistic missile...but China is trying hard!

I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning.
We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO &amp; military. Very bad for U.S. This will change
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. &amp; how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes immediately and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved fast and easy. Dems would do it no doubt!
Despite the constant negative press covfefe

Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump &amp; Russia.
By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!

WEEKLY ADDRESS🇺🇸 https://t.co/P1f12i9Gvt
Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums &amp; deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor keep your plan?
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!
"Obama Administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?"
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
"...and did not want to ""rock the boat."" He didn't ""choke"" he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good."
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
"..under a magnifying glass they have zero ""tapes"" of T people colluding. There is no collusion &amp; no obstruction. I should be given apology!"
Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash &amp; burn!
Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!
"From @FoxNews ""Bombshell: In 2016 Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election.""  Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!"
Great day for America's future Security and Safety courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. I will keep fighting for the American people &amp; WIN!
"Wow CNN had to retract big story on ""Russia"" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!"
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS &amp; ABC? What about the failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!
With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard!
I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right unlike OCare!
The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!

The G 20 Summit was a great success for the U.S. - Explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made. Will get done!
I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....
...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
Putin &amp; I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking &amp; many other negative things will be guarded..
...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA &amp; FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER and were rejected still don't....
...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian &amp; Syrian problems are solved!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/NVDVRrWLs4
"For years even as a ""civilian"" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!"
Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good!
The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can&amp; did!
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!

Heading back to Washington D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade the military and security!
Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
"Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is ""sick."" All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!"
The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!
The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is &amp; it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!

...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia including Podesta Company Uranium deal Russian Reset big dollar speeches etc.
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media &amp; authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (&amp; acid washed) her 33000 e-mails!
In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci he wanted to endorse me 1st before the Republican Primaries started but didn't think I was running!
The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and after 7 years vote to Repeal and Replace. Next Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!

As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians!
It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President.
It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion even if should be positive is bad!
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!

Big day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!

3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal. Watch!
If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority not senseless 60...
...Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51 some really good things need 60. So many great future bills &amp; budgets need 60 votes....

Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE!
The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart!
If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE!
"After seven years of ""talking"" Repeal &amp; Replace the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare!"
If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!
U.S. Stock Market up almost 20% since Election!
Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters Repeal &amp; Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
"I love reading about all of the ""geniuses"" who were so instrumental in my election success. Problem is most don't exist. #Fake News! MAGA"
I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade yet...

Don't give up Republican Senators the World is watching: Repeal &amp; Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option) get Cross State Lines &amp; more.
If ObamaCare is hurting people &amp; it is why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies &amp; why should Congress not be paying what public pays?

Thank you West Virginia! All across the country Americans of every kind are coming together w/one simple goal: to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/thRh7htVbH
Toyota &amp; Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!
....and don't forget that Foxconn will be spending up to 10 billion dollars on a top of the line plant/plants in Wisconsin.
"Consumer confidence is at a 16 year high....and for good reason. Much more regulation ""busting"" to come. Working hard on tax cuts &amp; reform!"
West Virginia was incredible last night. Crowds and enthusiasm were beyond GDP at 3% wow!Dem Governor became a Republican last night.
Excellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!
No matter the mission the brave men &amp; women of our @USCG proudly answer the call to serve 24/7/365. THANK YOU and HAPPY BIRTHDAY! #CG227🇺🇸 https://t.co/GY555t0vzN

The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!
After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security the tougher the better!

Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.
The failing @nytimes which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized) is totally inept!
The Trump base is far bigger &amp;  stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn Iowa Ohio.......
...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story record Stock Market border security military strength jobs.....
... Supreme Court pick economic enthusiasm deregulation &amp; so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. Will never change!
Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN ABC NBC CBS NYTIMES &amp; WAPO the Trump base is getting stronger!
Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings.
Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist!
Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and....
...conquests how brave he was and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?
On #PurpleHeartDay💜I thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this GREAT NATION! #USA🇺🇸 https://t.co/QmfdLSLp6p
The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources) remain in business?
I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there
I will be holding a major briefing on the Opioid crisis a major problem for our country today at 3:00 P.M. in Bedminster N.J.

Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!
My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....
...Hopefully we will never have to use this power but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!

Deepest condolences to the families &amp; fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces.
Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today and best regards to all of those injured in Charlottesville Virginia. So sad!
Heading to Washington this morning. Much work to do. Focus on trade and military. #MAGA
Luther Strange of the Great State of Alabama has my endorsement. He is strong on Border &amp; Wall the military tax cuts &amp; law enforcement.
The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History. I am changing that fast!
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Councilhe will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
.@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher &amp; higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back &amp; LOWER PRICES!
Big day in Washington D.C. even though White House &amp; Oval Office are being renovated. Great trade deals coming for American workers!
Leaving for New York City and meetings on military purchases and trade.
Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!
Feels good to be home after seven months but the White House is very special there is no place like it... and the U.S. is really my home!
Senator Luther Strange who is doing a great job for the people of Alabama will be on @foxandfriends at 7:15. Tough on crime borders etc.
@foxandfriends According to report just out President Obama knew about Russian interference 3 years ago but he didn't want to anger Russia!
Big day in Alabama. Vote for Luther Strange he will be great!
For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!
Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!
Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama. Exciting race!
Congratulations John! https://t.co/vhmv7Qoutk
Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wow Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement. Now in September runoff. Strong on Wall &amp; Crime!
Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!

Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK neo-Nazis &amp; white supremacists......
...and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!
The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate bigotry etc. Shame!
Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake who is WEAK on borders crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!
Many meetings today in Bedminster including with Secretary Linda M and Small Business. Job numbers are looking great!
Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You.....
...can't change history but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee Stonewall Jackson - who's next Washington Jefferson? So foolish! Also...
...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!
The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona Spain and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough &amp; strong we love you!
Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!
Homeland Security and law enforcement are on alert &amp; closely watching for any sign of trouble. Our borders are far tougher than ever before!
The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult. They use the courts and associated delay at all times. Must stop!
Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary! The courts must give us back our protective rights. Have to be tough!

We will confront ANY challenge no matter how strong the winds or high the water. I’m proud to stand with Presidents for #OneAmericaAppeal.
Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion perhaps bigger than we have ever seen. Be safe and get out of its wayif possible. Federal G is ready!
Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15000 lives last week with Harvey. Irma could be even tougher. We love our Coast Guard!
Republicans sorry but I've been hearing about Repeal &amp; Replace for 7 years didn't happen! Even worse the Senate Filibuster Rule will....
...never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!
Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!

Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!
Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off &amp; use better!
The travel ban into the United States should be far larger tougher and more specific-but stupidly that would not be politically correct!
We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.Must be proactive &amp; nasty!

I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal &amp; Replace.
The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther. He won't let you down!

Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!
Heading to Alabama now big crowd!
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!
Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad
Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp;  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare worst in the country. Deductibles high people angry! Lisa M comes through.
It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn!
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country! https://t.co/yFv0WIjgby
Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!
"Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a ""moment of courage."" Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!"
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they won't be around much longer!
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Alaska Arizona Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal &amp; Replace and some Senators not there.
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.https://t.co/KJ886okyfC
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp; reform.
#StandForOurAnthem
.@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG ANTHEM COUNTRY. Total lie!
General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthem🇺🇸
Texas &amp; Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure &amp; massive debt is in deep trouble..

Big election tomorrow in the Great State of Alabama. Vote for Senator Luther Strange tough on crime &amp; border - will never let you down!
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
...But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team they ALL stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made - we love our country!
But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!

Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017. Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.
Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz the Mayor of San Juan for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way
The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!
ALABAMA get out and vote for Luther Strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down! #MAGA

The Mayor of San Juan who was very complimentary only a few days ago has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.
...Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan and others in Puerto Rico who are not able to get their workers to help. They....
...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.
The military and first responders despite no electric roads phones etc. have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.
"Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to ""get Trump."" Not fair to FR or effort!"
I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).
The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!
Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!
The Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello is a great guy and leader who is really working hard. Thank you Ricky!
Just spoke to Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands who stated that #FEMA and Military are doing a GREAT job! Thank you Governor!
Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people. Thank you!

We must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster.
Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor. Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!
I will be in PR on Tues. to further ensure we continue doing everything possible to assist &amp; support the people in their time of great need.
Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow and always for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!

A great day in Puerto Rico yesterday. While some of the news coverage is Fake most showed great warmth and friendship.
Wow so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!
NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!
The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!
I will be landing in Las Vegas shortly to pay my respects with @FLOTUS Melania. Everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers.

Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!
Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign. This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews. Low news and reporting standards. No verification from me.
Ralph Northamwho is running for Governor of Virginiais fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs &amp; sanctuary cities.  Vote Ed Gillespie!
"Can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost. It discusses the enthusiasm of ""Trump"" voters through campaign...."
...contributions. The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems and much of it by my wonderful small donors. I am working hard for them!
"Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very ""unfunny"" &amp; repetitive material always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?"
More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken big premiums. Who knows!

"Senator Bob Corker ""begged"" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ""NO"" and he dropped out (said he could not win without..."
"..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State I said ""NO THANKS."" He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!"
...Hence I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!
I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate. Military helping. Very much under control!
Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal &amp; that's about it. We need HealthCare we need Tax Cuts/Reform we need people that can get the job done!
Nobody could have done what I’ve done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work! https://t.co/k2jAkIpfjI
The Republican Party is racking up record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by Trump supporters.....   @nypost  Thank you!
Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years giving billions of dollars &amp; getting nothing. Policy didn't work!
The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!

The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure bordersthey don't care about safety for U.S.A.

Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th a 25% increase. Lowest unemployment in 16 years and..
...if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA
It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.Need tax cuts
The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases &amp; soft crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history &amp; the WALL!
It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY

...people not interviewed including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?
The Democrats will only vote for Tax Increases. Hopefully all Senate Republicans will vote for the largest Tax Cuts in U.S. history.
As it has turned out James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!
Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!

Great Tax Cut rollout today. The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!
Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H....
....This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?
The @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch. James Comey's leadership was a disaster!
I will be interviewed by @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews at 10:00. Enjoy!
My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems..
...New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails Uranium Podesta the Server plus plus...
....People are angry.  At some point the Justice Department and the FBI must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!
The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC &amp; then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI &amp; Justice Dept.
"ISIS just claimed the Degenerate Animal who killed and so badly wounded the wonderful people on the West Side was ""their soldier."" ....."
"...Based on that the Military has hit ISIS ""much harder"" over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!"
Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!
I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders not Crooked H without cheating I was right.
Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor. Will then be heading to Japan SKorea China Vietnam &amp; the Philippines. Will never let you down!

I don’t blame China I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would've done same!
My meetings with President Xi Jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea. He is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. It was great being with him and Madame Peng Liyuan!
I am leaving China for #APEC2017 in Vietnam. @FLOTUS Melania is staying behind to see the zoo and of course the Great WALL of China before going to Alaska to greet our AMAZING troops.

President Xi of China has stated that he is upping the sanctions against #NoKo. Said he wants them to denuclearize. Progress is being made.
Will be doing a joint press conference in Hanoi Vietnam then heading for final destination of trip the Phillipines.
Met with President Putin of Russia who was at #APEC meetings. Good discussions on Syria. Hope for his help to solve along with China the dangerous North Korea crisis. Progress being made.
When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea Syria Ukraine terrorism and Russia can greatly help!
Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also but he had zero chemistry with Putin.
"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ""old"" when I would NEVER call him ""short and fat?"" Oh well I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!"

I am proud of the Rep. House &amp; Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {&amp; reform.} We’re getting close! Now how about ending the unfair &amp; highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare &amp; reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?
Excited to be heading home to see the House pass a GREAT Tax Bill with the middle class getting big TAX CUTS!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain🇺🇸
Great to see @RandPaul looking well and back on the Senate floor. He will help us with TAX CUTS and REFORM!
After my tour of Asia all Countries dealing with us on TRADE know that the rules have changed. The United States has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion. The massive TRADE deficits must go down quickly!
Just arrived at #ASEAN50 in the Philippines for my final stop with World Leaders. Will lead to FAIR TRADE DEALS unlike the horror shows from past Administrations. Will then be leaving for D.C. Made many good friends!
I will be making a major statement from the @WhiteHouse upon my return to D.C. Time and date to be set.

Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!
The failing @nytimes hates the fact that I have developed a great relationship with World leaders like Xi Jinping President of China.....
...They should realize that these relationships are a good thing not a bad thing. The U.S. is being respected again. Watch Trade!
It is actually hard to believe how naive (or dumb) the Failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...weak and ineffective!
Why are Democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business (jobs)? The reason: Obstruction and Delay!
Big vote tomorrow in the House. Tax cuts are getting close!
To the three UCLA basketball players I say:  You're welcome go out and give a big Thank You to President Xi Jinping of China who made.....
....your release possible and HAVE A GREAT LIFE! Be careful there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!

Great numbers on Stocks and the Economy. If we get Tax Cuts and Reform we'll really see some great results!
If Democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes we would be able to get many of their ideas into Bill!

Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time. She just can’t stop which is so good for the Republican Party. Hillary get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail LaVar Ball the father of LiAngelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!
Sen. Jeff Flake(y) who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President. He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast.”
Shoplifting is a very big deal in China as it should be (5-10 years in jail) but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!
Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.
Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will and must build the Wall!

Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.

It wasn’t the White House it wasn’t the State Department it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King but without the hair. Just think..
...LaVar you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal especially in China. Ungrateful fool!
The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That’s almost as bad as kneeling! When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!.....

Back in D.C. big week for Tax Cuts and many other things of great importance to our Country.  Senate Republicans will hopefully come through for all of us. The Tax Cut Bill is getting better and better. The end result will be great for ALL!
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks plus CNN and not including Fox is the most dishonest corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
The good news is that their ratings are terrible nobody cares! https://t.co/I7h4Ryin3h

Now we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to RESTORE AMERICAN PROSPERITY – and RECLAIM AMERICA’S DESTINY.But in order to achieve this bright and glowing future the SENATE MUST PASS TAX CUTS – and bring Main Street roaring back to life!https://t.co/jMNwEMrbbr https://t.co/3Niu0thp1D

The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews
The only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!

Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
The Failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the Democrat Party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!
The Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue!  @foxandfriends
The Chinese Envoy who just returned from North Korea seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.
Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!
The Dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence which is also at an all-time high would be “low and glum!”

A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!
The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!

I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

Great job First Lady Melania! https://t.co/TRuvaftPcD
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system or just a double standard?
Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and “acid washed” 33000 Emails? No justice!
Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News!
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco! https://t.co/MSIkBCKF3t
Tainted (no very dishonest?) FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review.” Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness.
People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE”  Now it all starts to make sense!
Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life V.A. Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!
Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more. Look at your 401-k’s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!
With the great vote on Cutting Taxes this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!

A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat Jones in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.
Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?
CNN’S slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!

Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important but SPECIAL!
Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!
Another false story this time in the Failing @nytimes that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong!  Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting.
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!
Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill &amp; Crooked-USED!
The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion weak on Crime Military and Illegal Immigration Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!
Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).

Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!
The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily) is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.  I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
Wow more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends

Remember the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.
How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the man in charge along with leakin’ James Comey of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!
Wow “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned” according to @FoxNews.
The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!
Remember the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper” and he lost.  Good Republican candidates will win BIG!
.@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet) he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.”
The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Tax Cut/Reform Bill including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!

I hope everyone is having a great Christmas then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare the Democrats &amp; Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!
WOW @foxandfrlends  “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!
All signs are that business is looking really good for next year only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!

In the East it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country but not other countries was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage &amp; Russia hoax!
Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!
The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration &amp; ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!
Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption &amp; its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests
The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most.... https://t.co/W8rKN9B6RT
Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching! https://t.co/kvv1uAqcZ9
On Taxes: “This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow. Now real economics and jobs.” @WSJ Report
I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press” now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. Many stories &amp; reports a pure fiction!
Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!
“Trump Rally: Stocks put 2017 in the record books” https://t.co/0foQGaFjMh
Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!
If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning! https://t.co/9TzSC8F8vY
Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS VA Judges Strong Border 2nd A Tax Cuts &amp; more?
My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM

Iran the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!
As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter I want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest Fake News Media a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!
HAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and much faster than anyone thought possible!
Today it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life. We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve! https://t.co/0MdP9DDIAS https://t.co/LP2a8KCBAp
As I made very clear today our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval.
Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy! Couldn’t agree w/you more. TOGETHER we are #MAGA🇺🇸 https://t.co/QaxtqpyXTR
.@ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American’s SAFE. Everyone is so grateful!#LawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/HXCpTlruVo
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion &amp; yet on and on it goes. Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!
I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/ptXa1hAPwW https://t.co/yv6RALkQf3

Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama helping to further grow our economy! https://t.co/Kcg8IVH6iA
Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!
Disproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?” @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails?  What a mess!
In new Quinnipiac Poll 66% of people feel the economy is “Excellent or Good.” That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.” This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?
“45 year low in illegal immigration this year.” @foxandfriends
With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!
Great news as a result of our TAX CUTS &amp; JOBS ACT! https://t.co/SLvhLxP3Jl
Yesterday I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H.R. 2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. Together we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States! https://t.co/ELZvFol5Lo
Thank you Adam Levine The Federalist in interview on @foxandfriends  “Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen.”
Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. All business is just at the beginning of something really special!
More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan adding 2500 new jobs and paying $2000 bonus to U.S. employees! https://t.co/47azKD0l9B
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery &amp; Chain. USA!
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded Chain &amp; Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....
....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund....
....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten “shutdown” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most. Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!
Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!
Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately no trust!
Today it was my great honor to proclaim January 15 2018 as Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy. https://t.co/samlJsz1Nt
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!
The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad!
AMERICA FIRST!
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.
I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!
So much Fake News is being reported. They don’t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn’t say that. I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” a big difference. Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
...and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST
“President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers. Most explosive Stock Market rally that we’ve seen in modern times. 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth. All Trump not 0...
...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things). “President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline.” Thank you Stuart Varney.  @foxandfriends
Statement by me last night in Florida: “Honestly I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA but they don’t want to help..We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to. They don’t want security at the border they don’t want.....
...to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.” My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST &amp; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can’t get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.
Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!
“90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriends
Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews

ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more! Together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!
The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water.....
....The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!
Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal!
CHIP should be part of a long term solution not a 30 Day or short term extension!
A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!

House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!
Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!

Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown
For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans!
#AMERICA FIRST!
Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!
Beautiful weather all over our great country a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
Unprecedented success for our Country in so many ways since the Election. Record Stock Market Strong on Military Crime Borders &amp; ISIS Judicial Strength &amp; Numbers Lowest Unemployment for Women &amp; ALL Massive Tax Cuts end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!
The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation in just twelve months than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. The good news is THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!
Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now!
Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real long term budget no C.R.’s!
Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an “A”-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!
The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!
Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don’t want to do it but are powerless!
End the Democrats Obstruction! https://t.co/tzBXilvW1b
Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone including Republicans Democrats and DACA but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!
Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: “Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.” Thank you for your honesty Jim!
In one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok - Page texts perhaps 50000 all in prime time. Wow!
In one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts perhaps 50000 and all in prime time. Wow!
Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!
Thank you to General John Kelly who is doing a fantastic job and all of the Staff and others in the White House for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult but it is always great to WIN and few have won more than us!
Where are the 50000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?  Blaming Samsung!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands especially after his humiliating defeat that if there is no Wall there is no DACA. We must have safety and security together with a strong Military for our great people!

Democrats are not interested in Border Safety &amp; Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!
Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!

March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist Blame Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix NOW!
Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network for the first time ever with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart!
The Democrats just aren’t calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast or they’ll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast.
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank &amp; File are great people!

Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain “sacred cows.” Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well someday!
This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!
Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion!
“The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....
...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn’t straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” Wall Street Journal

Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory!
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!
Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!

Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery. If D’s oppose this deal they aren’t serious about DACA-they just want open borders. https://t.co/XDMcDOr9vM
We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system.  Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. https://t.co/rP9Gtr2E5N
Today we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13 and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it. Watch here: https://t.co/VPMTnko7Ik https://t.co/4OaXXuj9Va

The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!
Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Great religious and political leaders and many friends including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph will be there. Looking forward to seeing all!
Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares “IN GOD WE TRUST.” And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are “One Nation Under God.” #NationalPrayerBreakfast https://t.co/zukP40Ezpo
I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea China and the Middle East.

Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/yukxm48x9X
Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.
Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS!
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!
Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now!
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
According to the @nytimes a Russian sold phony secrets on “Trump” to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP!
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?
“My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier it shows that he’s been victimized. He’s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......
....agencies not just the FBI &amp; DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the @WestervillePD. https://t.co/AoingY77Ky
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/xV1lgfhjBU
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGA
4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.
Rep. Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong &amp; smart loves Pennsylvania &amp; loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!
Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy!
This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!
Thank you to Sue Kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain!
The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more. Bipartisan make deal Dems?
Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.
As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. Proclamation: https://t.co/Sw1iGIJgWV https://t.co/Nx0AEKZy5p
Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America’s depleted infrastructure. https://t.co/8ByoQJsjTT https://t.co/BVBRDvHfcC
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again!
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!
In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need. https://t.co/bu140nscez https://t.co/OoTXMCSexB
The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in America.” It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals) doesn’t build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa...
...lottery continues deadly catch-and-release and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill!
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida: https://t.co/RTQWAKiSnR https://t.co/Nhs32bm5zB
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.
Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
Our entire Nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in Parkland FL. To teachers law enforcement first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage! https://t.co/3yJsrebZMG https://t.co/ti791dENTy
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida. Will never forget them or the evening!
“Charges Deal Don A Big Win” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results.” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. “She lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.”
Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!
The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ
“I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.”Rob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads https://t.co/A5ft7cGJkE
Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to and now they just talk!
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company!
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!
Finally Liddle’ Adam Schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said “it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate?
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U.S. then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN. https://t.co/rYsv90cnvs
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!
Thank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo
My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race!
Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
Have a great but very reflective President’s Day!
Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?
.@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch and has my full support and endorsement!
The U.S. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations &amp; Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS JOBS JOBS
“The Faith of Donald Trump” a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read. Enjoy!
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
“There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .....
....The President Obama quote just before election. That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. Also they want to do nothing on DACA R’s want to fix!
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You’ve come a long way Matt!
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts. Total Fake News!
A woman I don’t know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......
....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrative.
"Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law. ""This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses."" https://t.co/w9aw68UwOj"
Bad ratings @CNN &amp; @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!
So true thank you! https://t.co/9TTXlfokYz
@CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session!
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.

I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN &amp; @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
....History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive defense alone won’t work!
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
What many people don’t understand or don’t want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing.                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M. to discuss School Safety.  Next week it will be with our Nation’s Governors. It’s been many years of all talk no action. We’ll get it done!

Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept &amp; have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big &amp; very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.
Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. @FoxNews. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP!
Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations!
Dems are no longer talking DACA! “Out of sight out of mind” they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!
BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen).
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!

I will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!
“He’s got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton’s criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that.” @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show
“I’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don’t see the evidence....in terms of the collusion it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.”  Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
“We’ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don’t see it.”  Judge Ken Starr

Big legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!
The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done faster than even Ronald Reagan. “We’re blown away” said Thomas Binion of Heritage President Trump “is very active very conservative and very effective. Huge volume &amp; spectrum of issues.”
I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!
45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS-13 thugs being hit hard.
Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!

The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!
If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People!
We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies &amp; jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new &amp; fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also Canada must..
...treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.
To protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.
It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come &amp; go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy!
Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!
We are getting it done - jobs and security! https://t.co/Ui8bubj7Yr
We will see what happens! https://t.co/Y1qxoAUfd9
Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding of course)!
Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that “President Trump has the right to end DACA.” President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn’t. I am waiting for the Dems they are running for the hills!
Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!
Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!
Great couple great book! https://t.co/cLDI79rin8
@MarkBurnettTV @RealRomaDowney From Bush 1 to present our Country has lost more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad policies &amp; leadership. Must win again!  #MAGA

China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States. Our relationship with China has been a very good one and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with. We must act soon!
The U.S. is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft. We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!
Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect &amp; build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends  and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.

Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives not just a freeze. Also no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!
JOBS JOBS JOBS! #MAGA https://t.co/YAaqRcA7ZS
Look forward to being in Pennsylvania tomorrow in support of Rick @Saccone4PA18. Big crowd expected in Moon Township. Vote Rick and see you there! #MAGA
That’s right @RepBost! Thank you for your support in helping put America back to work. It’s about JOBS JOBS JOBS for our incredible workers and putting AMERICA FIRST! https://t.co/ChUQEa6rsC
Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally the great nation of Australia!
The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be if completed a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined.
We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans.
Chinese President XI XINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!
Congratulations to Kristian Saucier a man who has served proudly in the Navy on your newly found Freedom. Now you can go out and have the life you deserve!
Chinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!
Spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan who is very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea. Also discussing opening up Japan to much better trade with the U.S. Currently have a massive $100 Billion Trade Deficit. Not fair or sustainable. It will all work out!
Heading to Moon Township Pennsylvania to be with a really good person State Representative Rick Saccone who is running for Congress. Big &amp; happy crowd (why not some of the best economic numbers ever). Rick will help me a lot. Also tough on crime &amp; border. Loves 2nd A &amp; VETS
North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment!
In the first hours after hearing that North Korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end the press was startled &amp; amazed.They couldn’t believe it. But by the following morning the news became FAKE.They said so what who cares!
The European Union wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade are complaining about the tariffs on Steel &amp; Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers &amp; tariffs on U.S. products going in we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!
Join me LIVE in Moon Township Pennsylvania at 7:00pmE. Great crowd for a #MAGA rally!https://t.co/PYJNg0WGDL
Epic crowd in Moon Township Pennsylvania tonight. Thank you! Get out on Tuesday and VOTE for Rick @Saccone4PA18. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/ckbCOsDQ2l
The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers John Dowd Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....
...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story Maggie Haberman a Hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access.
The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.
The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...A record in U.S. history. State Department Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW!
Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50% which is higher than Obama and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low.” They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.
Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry subject to State Law. Armed guards OK deterrent!.......
....On 18 to 21 Age Limits watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this but not much political support (to put it mildly).
If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs. Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems....Will raise taxes weak on Crime and Border.
It was my great honor to welcome the 2017 World Series Champion Houston @Astros to the @WhiteHouse! #HoustonStrong https://t.co/IO6B42jixA
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
The Economy is raging at an all time high and is set to get even better. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going!
Mike Pompeo Director of the CIA will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!
Heading to see the BORDER WALL prototypes in California! https://t.co/fU6Ukc271l
“According to the Center for Immigration Studies the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole...” https://t.co/NdLC6jZwWE
California’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous &amp; violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!
If we don’t have a wall system we’re not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL &amp; prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country &amp; the people of our country. We must enforce our laws &amp; protect our people! #BuildTheWall https://t.co/NGqNueukvj

Hundreds of good people including very important Ambassadors and Judges are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history!
Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today!
Five of our incredible @Cabinet Secretaries are testifying on the Hill this morning on the need to rebuild our Nation’s crumbling infrastructure. We need to build FAST &amp; we need to build for our FUTURE. Thank you @SenateCommerce for hosting this hearing! #InfrastructureInAmerica
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!
Thank you for hosting! #MAGA https://t.co/9pHH60DVlX
Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!

We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada a very good guy doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating) but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!

Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
Happy #StPatricksDay https://t.co/4vVsW2smhB
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice &amp; State. #DrainTheSwamp
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all and much more!
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” He said strongly “never no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet there is NO COLLUSION!
.@seanhannity on @foxandfriends now! Great! 8:18 A.M.
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!
The Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal!
Our Nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. And our continent was tamed by farmers. Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them and we are DELIVERING for them! #NationalAgricultureDay
AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!
Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona. I agree with @LouDobbs. Should have sought review.
“Special Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not. I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....
...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice!”  So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.
“Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not. I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council. I am still opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing not a bad thing.......
.....They can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine ISIS Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!
Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.
Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy but they just didn’t care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.
Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. He doesn’t know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!
Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well not saying that anymore!
As a candidate I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect American workers and defend our national security.  Today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment. https://t.co/7NBI0Dibmx https://t.co/nmzqos3BUA

I am pleased to announce that effective 4/9/18 @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.
House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign &amp; Russia. (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded.
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill.  1:00 P.M.
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again. To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills! https://t.co/kYwMk5AE5k
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday and we grieve the nation’s loss. We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. We are with you @EmmanuelMacron!
France honors a great hero. Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack. So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism. Even stronger measures needed especially at borders!
Because of the $700 &amp; $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!
Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame &amp; fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......
....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more) which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!

For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!
Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!

https://t.co/UM3YJ6lUiD
While we are on the subject it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned” and that...
...does not include the Fake Washington Post which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. “increased its parcel rates Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!
Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews
HAPPY EASTER!
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA. NEED WALL!
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws.....
...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress our country is being stolen!
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime!
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke.
Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!
So sad that the Department of “Justice” and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!

As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico &amp; Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS
Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!
39% of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!

The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The “Fakers” at CNN NBC ABC &amp; CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!
The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!
Check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting!
Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50% which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration.
I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don’t have a clue (or do they?)!

Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico &amp; Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era and other laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today.
We are not in a trade war with China that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!
